# **Introduction/Business Understanding**
### *Car Accidents have always had a huge impact on our society as they result in injuries, deaths and loss of capital. The value of the loss caused by an accident is known as the Accident severity. Accidents have become very common these days and the attention of researchers to determine the severity of the driver’s injuries has increased because not only does it concern the driver himself but also the officials as they can act quicker, build safer roads for the future and it is useful in determining the premiums for accident insurance. Therefore, it is essential that insurers have all the required data and information when it comes to pricing insurance products and providing new methods to improve the quantification of risk based on data. Furthermore, every accident analysis is based on accurate and comprehensive records which we will be using in this project. We are dealing with all the possible ways to reach the destination by predicting and overcoming the severity of the accident with all the different traffic conditions in order to improve the traffic safety measures and rules. The objectives of this car accident severity capstone project are collecting a database of car accidents that includes the factors (as light conditions, weather, road surface…) that affect built up roads’ safety, analyzing data for these factors, analyzing UK road accidents in 2019, determining the type of roads that have the highest and the lowest rate of accidents and finally propose measures to take regarding the factors and determine the riskiest road in order to improve the safety.*
