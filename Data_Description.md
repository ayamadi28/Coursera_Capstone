# **Data Description**
### *For this project, we will be using the python language and execute it in Watson studio IBM. After understanding the data (picking the right APIs for each file, studying the type of each attribute in each column, finding the NAN values…), we prepare the data by framing it, cleaning it, removing any unnecessary information and making it ready to be modeled. We will implement many machine learning techniques as the K-nearest neighbor method and decision tree to predict the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Then, we use the Jacob and F-1 square methods to evolve the model. Now we get to visualizing the data using different plots like matplotlib and seaborn functions, in order to find the best possible solutions to reduce the car accident severity.*
